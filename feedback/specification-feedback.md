Project Specification Feedback
==================

### The product backlog (10/10)
The specification is good. One thing you should include is a cost estimate for each feature, in hours. If the cost estimate is more than 5 or 8 hours, you should consider breaking the feature into smaller work units to improve your ability to track progress on it. Additionally, a spreadsheet-like format is easier to read for backlogs, rather than prose or bulleted lists. You could also explore existing online tools for generating and tracking work on a project.

### Data models (10/10)
Your models are good. However, if the relationship between Profile and Game is Many-to-Many, that means a player can join many games and will have a different score and enterRoomTime for each game. You might want to think about how to represent this relationship.

### Wireframes or mock-ups (10/10)
Your wireframes are fine.

### Additional Information
Please put your models and wireframes in the specification folder in your repository. I almost gave you 0's on these parts because I didn't see them at first.
